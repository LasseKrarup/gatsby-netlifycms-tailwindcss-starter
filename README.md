# ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the this starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/LasseKrarup/gatsby-netlifycms-tailwindcss-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    This starter uses `Yarn 3.2` as a package manager. This means, that Gatsby CLI commands should be run through `Yarn` commands.

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    yarn start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index-template.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **Test out NetlifyCMS in a local environment**
    
    You can run NetlifyCMS in a local playground and start messing around with the CMS.

    ```shell
    yarn cms
    ```

    Navigate to `localhost:8000/admin/` to access the content manager.
